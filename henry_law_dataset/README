A full list of the files in this supplement can be found in the MANIFEST
file. This README file summarizes their contents.

1) The files henry_*.f90 contain the Fortran 90 code that was used to
   convert the values from the original publications to a uniform format
   and unit. The code can be used to double-check that the conversion
   was done correctly. The relevant Fortran and related files are:

   henry.f90            main program
   henry_ref0500.f90    references    1 to  500
   henry_ref1000.f90    references  501 to 1000
   henry_ref1500.f90    references 1001 to 1500
   henry_ref2000.f90    references 1501 to 2000
   henry_ref2500.f90    references 2001 to 2500
   henry_ref3000.f90    references 2501 to 3000
   henry_ref3500.f90    references 3001 to 3500
   henry_util.f90       utilities
   henry_mem.f90        memory declarations
   henry.nml            namelist
   Makefile             Make utility to build executable from source code
   sfmakedepend         calculate dependencies between Fortran files
   input/*.dat          input files

   To see how the original literature data was converted, first find the
   reference in the bibliography file henry.bib and note the reference
   number (i.e., the BibTeX key). Next, open the appropriate
   henry_ref*.f90 file and find the subroutine for this reference.

2) If the original publications contained measurements at different
   temperatures, the fortran code often contains all individual data
   points, not just the regression line that was used to show the
   temperature dependence in the table. In addition, this supplement
   contains plots showing the data points as well as the regression
   lines:

   output/gnuplot/Tdep.pdf
   output/gnuplot/*.gnu      (gnuplot files with data)

3) If the Henry's law constants are needed in electronic form, it is
   cumbersome to extract them from the pdf of this article. Therefore,
   the files output/*.f90 in this supplement contain declarations of the
   Henry's law constants in Fortran 90 syntax:

   alpha.f90  [dimensionless]
   Hbp.f90    [mol/(kg*atm)]
   HbpSI.f90  [mol/(kg*Pa)]
   Hcc.f90    [dimensionless]
   Hcp.f90    [M/atm]
   HcpSI.f90  [mol/(m^3*Pa)]
   Hxp.f90    [1/atm]
   KHcc.f90   [dimensionless]
   KHpc.f90   [m3*atm/mol]
   KHpcSI.f90 [m3*Pa/mol]
   KHpx.f90   [atm]
